# Advent of Code 2024

[AOC](https://adventofcode.com/)

I'm trying to learn [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) this year.

From day 5, I will use Rust in [Rust project](/aoc)

# Rust

Is source is in `aoc` directory.

This is the command to run in bash for Rust:
```bash
cargo run $day $part < $input_file
```

`$day` is the day from AoC from day 5-..
`$part` is 1 or 2
`$input_file` is the input file from AoC, that you get from "get your puzzle input".

With samples from AoC or very big terminal sizes for some solutions, you can run this command to *vizualize* the solution!

```bash
cargo run -Fvizualize $day $part < $input_file
```
